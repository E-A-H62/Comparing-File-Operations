# File Operations Comparisons

## Contributing:

Elena Hernandez

## Introduction

This repository contains three files, each serving a specific purpose in exploring different approaches to reading and writing operations in the context of driver models. The goal is to showcase how different driver models perform read and write operations.

## Usage

The files in this repository are meant to demonstrate how different driver models can execute file operations.
- The read_write.c file holds an executable program that simulates simple read and write operations.
- The windowsReadWrite.c file contains an excerpt of code demonstrating how a Windows kernel-mode driver executes read and write operations.
- The linuxReadWrite.c file contains an excerpt of code demonstrating how a Linux kernel module executes read write and operations.
